# Task Tracker

This is a simple task tracker application written in nodejs using no any external libraries except for testing.

### Objectives
```
- Learn how to build application with CLI using NodeJS
- Learn how Jest works
```

### Used Technologies:
```
- NodeJs
- Jest (for testing)
```

### Instructions to run
- Confirm that `nodejs` is installed on your machine
- Download this repository and extract in preferred destination
- From the path of this project run command `npm run task-cli`
- You will be provided with a list of supported actions and the command patterns
- To get more help on sub-actions run cli command with `*gh`|`**get-help` (`-h` and `--help` is already used by `npm`). Example: `npm run task-cli list **get-help` 

### TODO
- Implementation of global help marked with `-h` or `--help`
- Implementation of test scenarios of CLI commands
